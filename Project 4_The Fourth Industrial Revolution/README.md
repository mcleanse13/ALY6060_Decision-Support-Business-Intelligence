In this project, I analyzed a large, multi-year environmental dataset to explore how climate change has impacted global agricultural systems and how embedded analytics can support better decision-making during the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I focused on descriptive and exploratory analytics to uncover patterns in temperature, precipitation, irrigation access, carbon emissions, extreme weather events, and crop yields across more than two decades. Using Tableau, I developed a series of visualizations—including line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and heatmaps—that helped me evaluate the historical relationship between climate trends and agricultural outcomes. My goal was to produce analysis that could be genuinely useful to stakeholders navigating ESG-related decisions, rather than a simple academic exercise.

Through this work, I found consistent global warming patterns, rising extreme weather events, and clear links between precipitation levels and crop yield performance. I also explored economic impacts, emissions disparities, and potential vulnerabilities within future agricultural production. This project helped me better understand how meaningful analytics—rooted in real data and real-world context—can drive decisions about sustainability, climate resilience, and long-term agricultural planning. It also reinforced the importance of adapting BI and data science practices as the Fourth Industrial Revolution continues to reshape the ways we collect, interpret, and act on complex data.
