Analyzing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies in Global Agriculture

For my final project in ALY 6060, I focused on analyzing the impact of climate change on the agricultural industry and the strategies countries have used to mitigate these effects over the past 25 years. I selected a dataset that included global agricultural metrics such as crop yields, irrigation levels, soil health indices, fertilizer and pesticide use, and adaptation strategies like crop rotation, drought-resistant crops, organic farming, and water management. Using descriptive analytics and multiple visualizations, I explored trends in extreme weather events, temperature fluctuations, and precipitation levels to understand how these environmental factors have influenced agricultural production worldwide. This allowed me to identify patterns and correlations that can inform future planning and policy decisions in agriculture.

Through the creation of heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots, I examined the relationships between climate change indicators and agricultural outcomes. For example, I found that countries with higher irrigation access were better able to manage fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, while those adopting innovative strategies like drought-resistant crops or organic farming had higher crop yields under challenging climate conditions. I also analyzed economic impacts, showing that despite global climate shifts, countries have managed to maintain relatively consistent economic returns from agriculture, with Nigeria leading in crop yield economic returns. The visualizations also revealed disparities in carbon emissions, highlighting that countries like the United States and Australia have significantly higher emissions, which may exacerbate extreme weather events globally.

Ultimately, this project demonstrated how data analytics can provide actionable insights for decision-making in response to climate change. By combining descriptive analysis with predictive insights from historical trends, I was able to highlight areas where adaptation strategies are working and where further improvements are needed. My findings emphasize the need for continued innovation in agricultural practices, reduction of emissions, and targeted resource allocation to ensure sustainable crop production in the face of global warming. This work not only strengthened my skills in data visualization and analysis but also illustrated the critical role analytics plays in addressing complex social and environmental challenges.
