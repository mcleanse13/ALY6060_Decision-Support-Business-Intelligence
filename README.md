# ALY6060_Decision-Support-Business-Intelligence

In ALY 6060, I focused on applying data analytics and business intelligence techniques to real-world social and environmental challenges, with an emphasis on climate change and its impact on the agricultural industry. I worked with datasets spanning 25 years, analyzing metrics like crop yields, irrigation, soil health, fertilizer and pesticide use, and adaptation strategies such as crop rotation, drought-resistant crops, organic farming, and water management. Using tools like Tableau, I created visualizations including heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots to explore trends in global temperatures, precipitation, extreme weather events, and economic outcomes, enabling me to identify patterns and correlations that inform future decision-making and policy planning in agriculture.

Through these analyses, I was able to evaluate the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies across countries and their relationships with economic returns, carbon emissions, and crop production. The insights gained from these projects demonstrated how descriptive and predictive analytics can guide actionable recommendations, such as optimizing irrigation, adjusting crop selection, and reducing emissions. Overall, ALY 6060 strengthened my skills in data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and evidence-based decision-making, while highlighting the critical role analytics plays in addressing complex environmental and social challenges.
