Data-Driven Stock Evaluation: Comparative Financial Analysis with Tableau

For this project, I analyzed five companies from the top 500 U.S. publicly traded firms to evaluate whether their stock should be considered for purchase. I selected companies within the same general industry and gathered key financial indicators such as market capitalization, revenue, earnings, P/E ratio, dividend percentage, and operating margin. After compiling the data in Excel, I imported it into Tableau and developed a set of visualizations to compare the companies across each metric. These dashboards allowed me to make evidence-based assessments and form clear recommendations about the strength of each company’s financial performance and stock value.

Using the insights from the Tableau visualizations, I created a written analysis explaining my rationale for recommending (or not recommending) the purchase of each stock. My evaluation focused on long-term performance factors such as shareholder returns, valuation concerns, operational efficiency, and the overall relationship between earnings and market value. This project strengthened my ability to integrate data visualization with financial analysis and demonstrated how data-driven insights can influence business and investment decisions.
