Building an Analytics-Driven Organization: Stakeholder Engagement, Strategic Tradeoffs, and Data Storytelling

This project explores the foundations of building a strong data analytics culture by examining the role of continuous stakeholder involvement in project success. In the first part, I analyze strategies for maintaining stakeholder engagement that included early identification, communication alignment, and collaborative decision-making, discussing the consequences organizations face when involvement is low, such as unclear decision rights, slowed progress, and reduced innovation. I also connect these stakeholder management strategies to the development of a data-driven culture by highlighting how transparency, shared accountability, and mission alignment help organizations integrate analytics into everyday decision-making. My analysis references course readings and professional articles to illustrate how effective engagement enhances data maturity across teams.

In the second and third parts of the project, I extend the discussion into broader business decision-making contexts. I provide an in-depth evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of venture capital funding, weighing access to capital, mentorship, and rapid scaling opportunities against challenges like loss of ownership, investor pressure, and lengthy due-diligence processes. Finally, I conducted a comparative analysis of the world’s top ten tech companies by market capitalization, producing several Tableau infographics that examine market cap, revenue, employee count, and operating margin performance. My visualizations and written conclusions highlight trends across the industry such as NVIDIA’s unusually high market value relative to revenue and Amazon’s workforce-driven scale, illustrating how data storytelling supports actionable insights in an analytics-driven environment.
