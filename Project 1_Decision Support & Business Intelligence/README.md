Foundations of Business Intelligence: Strategic Decision-Making and Tableau-Based Insights

In this project, I explored foundational concepts in Business Intelligence (BI), focusing on how data-driven decision-making supports organizational leadership. I began by examining the role and importance of business partners, emphasizing how collaboration, shared resources, and diverse perspectives can strengthen business outcomes. I also outlined the budgeting process, detailing how I would coordinate with cross-functional teams, establish project goals, select appropriate budget types, and ensure communication and alignment throughout the planning cycle. This section highlights my ability to combine business strategy with data-oriented thinking which are two essential components of BI.

For the second part of the assignment, I created a small analytical project using Tableau by gathering data on the first 16 U.S. Presidents. I built several visualizations which includes bar charts, scatterplots, line charts, symbol maps, and comparison views to identify patterns in their political affiliations, terms served, home states, life spans, and more. Through these dashboards, I explored meaningful relationships such as which political parties served the most terms, whether serving two terms affected life expectancy, and geographic patterns in presidential origins. This exercise strengthened my BI visualization skills and demonstrated my ability to turn structured historical data into clear, interpretable insights.
